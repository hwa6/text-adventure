Will need to refactor the Area returning true part. For now we're just using a "isLast" boolean. need something more clever
HealItem is going to need its own consumeItem method since this is not the same boolean as in Item class
Do we need a "consume" attribute? we can also just remove it from the inventory

Potential room puzzle ideas:
    Crossword, where it's a 2D array.
    Rotating tile puzzle. look up java console art, then segment it into quadrants  dash - maps to / then to | etc

We need to:
    when breaking out of sub room, automatically breaks out of next room too
    we need a better way to move backwards besides breakNav/isLast
    when we checkInventory, need to reprint the Where would you like to go message
    fix it so user can always check inventory, health
    add ability to heal w item 

next room is henry and nicoles future house
